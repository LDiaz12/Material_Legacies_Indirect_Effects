# Laurel's Thesis Updates 10/16

#### Material legacies as a result of disturbance events may indirectly alter the physiology of the tropical reef coral, *Porites rus*

## Questions

1.  How do simulated shifting community compositions as a result of disturbances change biogeochemistry?

2.  How does altered biogeochemistry indirectly impact physiological rates of photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification of *Porites rus*?

## Hypotheses

1.  Different dominant benthic communities will alter pH, total alkalinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), with the most significant changes at a peak daytime and peak nighttime.

![Table 1 - Effect of Dominant Benthic Community on Biogeochemistry](/Users/laureldiaz/Desktop/Masters_Thesis/Thesis_Proposal/Proposal_Presentation/H1.png)

2.  Changes in biogeochemistry will impact coral physiology by altering growth and metabolic rates of gross photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification in *Porites rus*.

![Table 2 - Effect of Changes in Biogeochemistry on Coral Physiology](/Users/laureldiaz/Desktop/Masters_Thesis/Thesis_Proposal/Proposal_Presentation/H2.png)

## Experimental Design

-   4 treatments (n = 4 replicates)
    -   "Pre" Disturbances: Coral-Dominated
    -   "Post-COTS Outbreak": Rubble-Dominated
    -   "Post-Bleaching Event": Algae-Dominated
    -   Seawater-Only Control
-   2 response tanks per treatment tank (n = 32 total)
    -   3 nubbins of *Porites rus* per response tank
-   25-day experimental period
-   Twice daily: pH, salinity, temperature, DO
-   Every 5 days (bottle samples): total alkalinity, DOC

## 24-hour Experiment: Determining Peak Day/Night Periods

From June 2nd - June 3rd, we gathered data every: 3 hours for pH (calculated using mV), temperature, salinity, and DO. Every 6 hours, we measured the aforementioned variables in addition to: flow rate (to calculate residence time, delta TA, and NEC), TA, and took samples for DOC.

```

## Chlorophyll Content

Chl density (chl a + chl c2 per unit SA) can tell us how "well" the corals are doing in each of the treatments, and can act as a proxy for symbiont and holobiont health. Joyce and Phinn 2003 showed that macroalgae had much greater mean chlorophyll a content compared to *Montipora* spp, *Porites* spp, and sediment + microalgae by more than double. 

### Load Chl Plates
```{r Chl data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
PlateData1<-read_csv(here("Data","Data_Raw", "Chl_Content", "Chl_Files", "MO24BEAST_Chl_Run1_Plate1.csv"), skip = 39) #skips first 39 lines
PlateData2<-read_csv(here("Data","Data_Raw", "Chl_Content", "Chl_Files", "MO24BEAST_Chl_Run1_Plate2.csv"), skip = 39)
PlateData2 <- PlateData2[-(24:96),] #this removes empty wells (e.g. not blanks or samples)
```

```{r Chl data combine plates, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plates_comb <- rbind(PlateData1, PlateData2)
plates_comb <- plates_comb[-c(1)]
```

### Load Chl Metadata
```{r Metadata, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
MetaData1<-read_csv(here("Data","Data_Raw","Chl_Content", "Chl_Files", "Metadata1.csv")) 
MetaData2<-read_csv(here("Data","Data_Raw","Chl_Content", "Chl_Files", "Metadata2.csv"))
MetaData2 <- MetaData2 %>% 
  filter(!CORAL_NUM == "EMPTY") # filters out empty wells
```

```{r combine metadata, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
metadata_comb <- rbind(MetaData1, MetaData2)
```
### Combine Plates and Metadata - Calculate Chlorophyll

Chl a
-   11.43 is the extinction coefficient of chla at wavelength 663
-   0.64 is the extinction coefficient of chla at wavelength 630

Chl c2
-   27.09 is the extinction coefficient of chl c2 at wavelength 630
-   3.63 is the extinction coefficient of chl c2 at wavelength 663

When calculating chlorophyll, we subtract from wavelength of 750 because this is a correction for the turbidity of the sample.

``` {r create full data sheet and mutate chl calculation columns, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
full_data <- cbind(metadata_comb,plates_comb)
full_data <- full_data %>% 
  # Calculate chl from Jeffrey and Humphrey (1975)
  # units in µg/ml
  mutate(Chla = (11.43*(`663`-`750`) - 0.64*(`630` - `750`))*1/0.6,
         Chlc = (27.09*(`630` - `750`) - 3.63*(`663` - `750`)*1/0.6))
```

### Normalize Data to Blank
```{r normalize to blanks, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
Data_norm <- full_data %>% 
  group_by(CORAL_NUM)%>%
  ungroup()%>% # ungroup data so I can just look at coral num and chlorophylls
  reframe(CORAL_NUM = CORAL_NUM,
          Chla_norm = Chla - Chla[CORAL_NUM == "BLANK"], # subtract chla value from blank normalize
          Chlc_norm = Chlc - Chlc[CORAL_NUM == "BLANK"],
          Chl_total = Chla_norm + Chlc_norm)
Data_norm2 <- cbind(full_data, Data_norm)
Data_norm2 <- Data_norm2[-c(11)]
```

### Normalize Chlorophyll Content to Surface Area of Corals
```{r normalize to SA, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
sa <- read_csv(here("Data", "Data_Raw", "Growth", "SA", "MO24BEAST_SA.csv"))
sa$CORAL_NUM <- as.character(sa$CORAL_NUM) # for some reason CORAL_NUM was reading in as double so change to character
chl_full <- full_join(Data_norm2, sa) #full join normalized chl data and surface area data
chl_full <- chl_full %>%                
  mutate(chla.ug.cm2 = Chla * 1 / SA_cm_2, 
         chlc2.ug.cm2 = Chlc * 1 / SA_cm_2) %>% #add in two new columns - chl a normalized to SA and chl b normalized to SA
  drop_na() 
```

### Plot for Chl a 
```{r chl a plots and stats, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chl_a_plot <- chl_full %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TREATMENT, y = chla.ug.cm2, color = TREATMENT)) +
  labs(x = "Treatment", y = "chlorophyll a (µg/cm2)") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +                                            # Plot all points
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, fun.args = list(mult = 1),    # Plot standard error
               geom = "errorbar", color = "black", width = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "black")   
chl_a_plot
```
### Stats for Chl a
```{r chl a stats, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chla_gen_trtmt_model <- lmer(Chla_norm~TREATMENT + (1|GENOTYPE) +(1|TANKID) + (1|GENOTYPE:TREATMENT) + (1|TANKID:TREATMENT), data=chl_full)
#plot(chla_gen_trtmt_model)
#qqp(residuals(chla_trtmt_model), "norm")
anova(chla_gen_trtmt_model)
```
```{r chl a stats wo randoms, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chla_trtmt_model <- lm(Chla_norm ~ TREATMENT, data=chl_full)
#plot(chla_trtmt_model)
#qqp(residuals(chla_trtmt_model), "norm")
anova(chla_trtmt_model)
```
```{r chl a stats model compare, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
anova(chla_gen_trtmt_model, chla_trtmt_model)
```

### Plot for Chl c
```{r chl c plot}
chl_c_plot <- chl_full %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TREATMENT, y = chlc2.ug.cm2, color = TREATMENT)) +
  labs(x = "Treatment", y = "chlorophyll c2 (µg/cm2)") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1) +                                            
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, fun.args = list(mult = 1),    
               geom = "errorbar", color = "black", width = 0.5) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = "point", color = "black")   
chl_c_plot
```
### Chl C Stats
```{r chl c stats, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chlc_gen_trtmt_model <- lmer(Chlc_norm~TREATMENT + (1|GENOTYPE) + (1|TANKID) + (1|GENOTYPE:TREATMENT) + (1|TANKID:TREATMENT), data=chl_full)
#plot(chlc_gen_trtmt_model) #yikes
#qqp(residuals(chlc_gen_trtmt_model), "norm")
anova(chlc_gen_trtmt_model)
``` 
```{r chl c stats w/o random effects, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chlc_trtmt_model <- lm(Chlc_norm ~ TREATMENT, data=chl_full)
#qqp(residuals(chlc_trtmt_model), "norm")
anova(chlc_trtmt_model)
```
The outliers seen in both Chl a and Chl c2 are most likely caused by an incorrect reading from the spec - these will be rerun here at CSUN, stay tuned! :) 

### Changes in Chl a and c

I wanted to see the change in Chl a and c content from the initial value ("Pre" experiment) and the final values (after exposure to each Treatment). Here, I'm taking the initial chlorophyll value and subtracting it from the final chlorophyll values for each Genotype in each Treatment.
```{r percent change chl a and c, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
chl_initial <- Data_norm2 %>%
  filter(TREATMENT == "Pre") %>% 
  select(TREATMENT, CORAL_NUM, GENOTYPE, Chla_norm, Chlc_norm)

full_data2 <- Data_norm2 %>%
  left_join(chl_initial, by = "GENOTYPE") %>%
  rename(Chla_norm_initial = Chla_norm.y,
         Chlc_norm_initial = Chlc_norm.y,
         CORAL_NUM = CORAL_NUM.x,
         TREATMENT = TREATMENT.x, 
         Chla_norm = Chla_norm.x,
         Chlc_norm = Chlc_norm.x, 
         )
full_data2 <- full_data2[-c(14:15)]

full_data2 <- full_data2 %>%
  mutate(Chla_diff = (Chla_norm - Chla_norm_initial),
         Chlc_diff = (Chlc_norm - Chlc_norm_initial)) %>%
  filter(!TREATMENT == "NA")

chla_change_plot <- full_data2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TREATMENT, y = Chla_diff, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Treatment", y = "Change in Chl a Content") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
chla_change_plot

chlc_change_plot <- full_data2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = TREATMENT, y = Chlc_diff, color = TREATMENT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  labs(x = "Treatment", y = "Change in Chl c2 Content") +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1)
chlc_change_plot
```
