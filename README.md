# Material Legacies as a Result of Disturbances May Indirectly Alter the Physiology of the Tropical Reef Coral, _Porites rus_
This repository contains code and data for a master's thesis project at California State University, Northridge by Laurel Diaz under the advisement of Dr. Nyssa Silbiger. Data were collected from Mo'orea, French Polynesia on the north shore of the island on the back reef. This project seeks to answer how material legacies from disturbance events may indirectly alter coral physiology. Data, scripts, and outputs are related to mimicked community compositions following different disturbance regimes resulting in differing dominant benthic substrates and their indirect effects on the physiological processes of the coral _Porites rus_.

**Funding**: This research was funded by California State Univeristy, Northridge (CSUN) Graduate Student Thesis Support, College of Science and Mathematics Graduate Fellowship for Outstanding Research Promise, California State University Council on Ocean Affairs, Science and Technology (COAST) Dr. Kenneth H. Coale Graduate Scholar Award, and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP) all to LCD. Funding was also provided by . This work represents a contribution to the Mo'orea Coral Reef (MCR) LTER Site. Research was completed under permits issued by the French Polynesian Government.
