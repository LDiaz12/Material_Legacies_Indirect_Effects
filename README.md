# material_legacies_indirect_effects
This repository contains code and data for a master's thesis project at California State University, Northridge. Data are collected from Mo'orea, French Polynesia on the north shore of the island on the fore reef at a 10-meter depth. This project seeks to answer how material legacies from disturbance events may indirectly alter coral physiology.
