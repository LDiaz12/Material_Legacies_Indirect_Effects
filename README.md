# material_legacies_indirect_effects
This repository contains code and data for a master's thesis project at California State University, Northridge by Laurel Diaz under the advisement of Dr. Nyssa Silbiger. Data are collected from Mo'orea, French Polynesia on the north shore of the island on the fore reef at a 10-meter depth. This project seeks to answer how material legacies from disturbance events may indirectly alter coral physiology. Data, scripts, and outputs are related to mimicked community compositions following different disturbance regimes and their indirect effects on the physiological processes of the coral genera _Pocillopora_ spp.
